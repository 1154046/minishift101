# Introduction to Kubernetes

This repository contains the material for the Kubernetes 101 workshop run by IBM Code.

The host-guided [workshop], with detailed explanations about the principles of operating an application in a Kubernetes environment, should take 2-4 hours (including some time for set-up) so don't feel bad if you don't finish everything. The plan is to leave you with some extra content you can take away to work on if you wish.
