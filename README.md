# Introduction to Kubernetes

This repository contains the material for the Kubernetes 101 workshop run by IBM Code.

If you were not present at the meetup it is highly recommended that you read the slides and/or watch the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBPgtYTZqA4) before attempting the workshop.

The [Workshop], with detailed explanations about the principles of operating an application in a Kubernetes environment, gives you a taste of deploying and scaling applications.
